# 🎨 ShilpSetu

A Vocal-for-Local Digital Storefront for Artisans 🛍️✨

---

## 📖 Overview

**ShilpSetu** is a mobile-first application designed to empower local artisans and craftsmen by providing a simple and accessible digital storefront. The app enables artisans to showcase handmade products, manage orders, and connect directly with buyers while preserving craft identity, regional origin, and cultural value.

Unlike generic e-commerce platforms, ShilpSetu emphasizes community-driven commerce, where every product represents the artisan, the craft, and its locality.

---

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

Local artisans face significant challenges in adopting digital platforms. They often lack an easy way to display their creations online, manage orders efficiently, or reach buyers beyond physical markets and exhibitions. Existing e-commerce solutions are complex, commission-heavy, and fail to reflect the cultural and local identity of handmade crafts.

---

## 💡 Solution

ShilpSetu provides a lightweight, mobile-first digital storefront that allows artisans to create personalized stores, list products with craft stories and origin details, manage carts and orders, and interact directly with buyers. The platform bridges the gap between traditional craftsmanship and modern digital commerce while supporting the “Vocal for Local” initiative.
